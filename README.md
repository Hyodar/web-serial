# web-serial

A serial monitor you can actually use with **just your browser**.

**No** additional downloads and **no** hassle.
Just go to [hyodar.github.io/webserial](hyodar.github.io/webserial) and enjoy.








Oh, you thought you needed a tutorial? Nah, you don't.
I might as well write something here in the future, but, trust me, you'll be fine.
