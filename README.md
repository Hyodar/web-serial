# web-serial

#### (This project is not being actively maintained since 2021, when I used it for a personal project. I'll leave it here as a WebSerial API usage example and, if anyone wants to submit a PR, I can also take a look at it.)

A serial monitor you can actually use with **just your browser**.
Just go to [hyodar.github.io/web-serial](https://hyodar.github.io/web-serial) and enjoy.
