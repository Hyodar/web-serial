# web-serial

A serial monitor you can actually use with **just your browser**.

**No** additional downloads and **no** hassle.
Just go to [hyodar.github.io/web-serial](https://hyodar.github.io/web-serial) and enjoy.

**But**
The WebSerialAPI, which is used in this project, is only implemented in a few browsers.
Chromium-based browsers, like Chrome, Opera, Edge and some others already support this!

## How to use

Oh, you thought you needed a tutorial? Nah, you don't.
I might as well write something here in the future, but, trust me, you'll be fine.
